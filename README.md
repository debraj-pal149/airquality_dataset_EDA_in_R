# airquality_dataset_EDA_in_R
Exploratory data analysis in R of airquality dataset (described in https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/airquality)  available in the R datasets library.

The project includes code to obtain
1. A description of the variables in terms of their mean, median, min, max and quantiles
2. Histograms and boxplots for the feature variables
3. Pairwise scatter plots of the feature variables to detect relationships and correlations between variables
4. Correlation matrix 
5. Boxplots of features compared by each month
6. A plot of mean temperature for each month
7. Computing the cumulative density function, probability density function and qqplot for all variables
